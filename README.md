This is an app for room's interior design.

The functionalities are:

1. Users start in a room. They can change their viewing angle by flipping vertically or horizontally as well as zoom in or zoom out of the room. 

2. They can change the room's size.

3. Users can tap "Find Furniture" to reach a furniture list where lists a collection of furniture existing in the web backend.

4. Users can tap furniture's thumbnails to download their associated 3D model data and tap a thumbnail again to go back to the room's view with the selected furniture appearing at the center of the room.

5. Users can click on any furniture to select it and then choose to translate, rotate or delete it. Users can change furniture's horizontal position through drag-and-drop or change their vertical position through pinching.

6. Users can click the save button to persist their design.

7. Users can zoom in or zoom out.

Remarks:

The backend API is hosted at Parse.com, created by myself.
